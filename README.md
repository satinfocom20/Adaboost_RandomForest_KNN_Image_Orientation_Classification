# Adaboost_RandomForest_KNN_Image_Orientation_Classification
These days, all modern digital cameras include a sensor that detects which way the camera is being held when a photo is taken. This meta-data is then included in the image file, so that image organization programs know the correct orientation |
i.e., which way is "up" in the image. But for photos scanned in from film or from older digital cameras, rotating images to be in the correct orientation must typically be done by hand. Here we create a classifier that decides the correct orientation of a given image. We use the below 3 algorithms to build the classifier and pick the one performs best.
